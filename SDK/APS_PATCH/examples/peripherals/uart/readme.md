# Function
This example introduces how to set OPL1000 IO peripheral to UART port.  In thie demo two UART ports are defined. One is UART0 which works at simple mode (2 signals). The other one is UART1 works at flow control mode (4 signals).  

In order to run this demo external UART device connection is required. 

# Notes
- UART resource and work mode can be set by PinMux tool. 
- PinMux tool is provided under Tool\PinMux folder. 
- Refer Doc\OPL1000-pinmux-tool-user-guide.pdf to know how to use PinMux tool.
