 * Routine:  sys_thread_new
 *---------------------------------------------------------------------------*
 * Description:
 *      Starts a new thread with priority "prio" that will begin its
 *      execution in the function "thread()". The "arg" argument will be
 *      passed as an argument to the thread() function. The id of the new
 *      thread is returned. Both the id and the priority are system
 *      dependent.
 * Inputs:
 *      char *name              -- Name of thread
 *      void (* thread)(void *arg) -- Pointer to function to run.
 *      void *arg               -- Argument passed into function
 *      int stacksize           -- Required stack amount in bytes
 *      int prio                -- Thread priority
 * Outputs:
 *      sys_thread_t            -- Pointer to per-thread timeouts.
